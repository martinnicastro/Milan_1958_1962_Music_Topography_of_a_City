# <a href="https://musictopography.github.io/mappa_circuiti_performativi.html"> Performers Circuits Map (PCM) Milan 1958-1962: Music Topography of a City

This repository contains an R code for creating an interactive web map using leaflet libraries. This map features geolocalized network graphs showing the performative circuits of the city. The layers are the result of a modularity analysis conducted on the relations between musicians and the venues in which they performed; the lines connecting the venues visualize the number of performers that played in the same places. The graphs where created in Gephi, then exported and converted in .shp files using QGIS.

Data

The repository contains all the .shp and .csv files required for compiling the map.
